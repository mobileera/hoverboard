Mobile Era 2016 is now over. It was a great success.
 We are happy to share with you some facts, emotions and, of course, photos from the biggest mobile conference in Norway!

Watch 2016's [photos](https://www.facebook.com/pg/mobileeraconf/photos/?tab=albums) and [videos](https://vimeo.com/mobileera/).

**These two days were full of discoveries and records:**

* 300+ visitors.
* 3 parallel tracks of mobile technologies.
* 48 sessions. No marketing - just technical hardcore!
* 50 speakers from around the world.

We are looking forward to Mobile Era 2017!
