We are proud to announce the speakers selected to educate and entertain you at Mobile Era 2017.
We received over five times as many submissions to our call-for-papers as we had slots in the
program, so our program committee had a hard job of choosing the best submissions to create
a program that will ensure that all our participants gets the best content, no matter what
mobile technologies they are interested in.

Here are some of the talks we are excited to bring you at Mobile Era 2017:
