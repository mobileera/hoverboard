We received a lot of amazing technical talks submissions, enough to hold some Mobile Eras in a row. But we'll pick only the best for you! Hard work for program committees is ahead!

Like the last year, we'll have some separate committees, with the professionals from corresponding areas. Stay tuned, we'll publish the program soon!

Anyway, if you feel, that you HAVE to share your passion with Mobile Era attendees by presenting your technical session, contact us immediately: [contact@mobileera.rocks](mailto:contact@mobileera.rocks)
