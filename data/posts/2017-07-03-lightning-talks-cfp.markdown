Mobile Era is now accepting Lightning Talk Submissions. Accepted lightning talk
candidates will receive a free ticket for the conference (in the event that you
have already purchased a ticket, you can bring a friend for free instead or get
the ticket refunded). If you have already submitted a lightning talk through the
regular CfP you do not need to submit again.

Lightning Talks will be 10 minutes long. The requirement is that you send the slides to us
(in either PPTX, PDF or Keynote format) two days in advance (October 3rd). We will provide
a computer with the talk available. This is to avoid technical difficulties of switching
computers between the presentations. If your talk requires you to run your own computer,
we'll try to accommodate it but cannot guarantee it

You can submit your lightning talk here: https://goo.gl/forms/rYAulKo2uHT5RKxv1
