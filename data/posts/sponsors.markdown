# Sponsor Packages

Mobility is increasingly becoming a differentiating factor for great products. This creates new challenges for developers and architects. While your technical people know software development well, mobile technology advances at a pace that leaves many wishing for more in-depth knowledge.

The community around mobile web technologies – Android, iOS and hybrid – has gathered great interest both in Norway and worldwide. At Mobile Era, the communities and companies are coming together to create the number one arena for mobile developers for the second year in a row. Be there to take part in the mobile revolution!

The conference will have three tracks, cover two full days and include a day of workshops plus a conference party. We hope to gather 500 attendees from Norway, Europe and beyond. Make sure to check out the highlight video from last year.

The conference is managed through a non-pro t organization. The organizations’ board of directors represents a wide spectrum of companies in Oslo.
