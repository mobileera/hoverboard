Get ready for Mobile Era 2017
=============================

Mobile Era is less than a week away and we're psyched to give you probably the strongest line-up of a cross platform mobile conference ever. If you haven't bought your ticket yet, be sure to [do so now!](https://ti.to/mobile-era/2017)

Even before the conference starts, we will be starting out with [three top notch workshops](https://mobileera.rocks/workshops), covering React Native, Kotlin and RxSwift. There are still seats available, [order your ticket now](https://ti.to/mobile-era/2017)

We will be kicking off with not one, but two keynotes. It will be hard to choose: Chris Heilmannn will share the secrets of how to make mobile web sites into proper alternatives to native apps, while Corey Latislaw will inspire you on how to channel your creativity into becoming a super developer.

After that, we will be running three tracks in parallel. We are aware that our audience is composed of developers who prefer to work with Android, iOS or mobile web and we have ensured that no matter what is your preference, you will always have something exciting to listen to.

Based on last years' feedback, we have tried to select more advanced talks and we trust that everyone will learn something new and useful.

We also feel that an essensial feature of a conference is the possibility of socializing with smart people. Be sure to stay Thursday evening for the Mobile Era party.

We're looking forward to welcoming you into the Mobile Era!
